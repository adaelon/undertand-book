# SESSION_CHECKPOINT - 2026-06-26 10:45

## Freshness check
- Commit at write time: 20f824b docs: add profile prebuild slices
- On read, compare with `git log -3`; if different, trust git log.

## What's in progress
Profile deep path P2/P2a are complete and pushed. A documentation audit found missing prebuild outputs for ADR-0033 profile artifacts; PB0-PB4 have been added to the profile slice plan and ADR-0033 now records that execution note.

## Next steps (ready to hand off)
1. Start PB0 from `docs/切片方案-profile深路径.md`: implement profile artifact header construction and `profile_metadata.json` write path.
2. Before PB0 code edits, inspect current build output path in `skills/build/pass1-batch.ts` and existing profile artifact types in `packages/core/src/pass2.ts`.
3. Keep PB0-PB4 separate from P3/P4/P5; do not mix prebuild sidecar output with reader command policy or memory consolidation.
4. Leave `参考2.md` and `.fluid/` untracked unless the user explicitly asks to version them.

## Working rules
- Commit messages must start with the concrete slice id from the plan (`P0`, `P1`, `P2a`, `PB0`, `PB1`, etc.) followed by the implemented function; examples: `PB0 profile metadata: add header writer`, `P2a book.context discourse projection: add discourse via`. Do not use a loose label like `Checkpoint rules` as the slice name.

## Uncommitted / unfinished
- `参考2.md`: user-provided source material, still untracked.
- `.fluid/`: untracked local/runtime directory, not part of this slice.
- No tracked code/doc changes are pending.

## Cold-start reading sequence
1. `docs/切片方案-profile深路径.md` - PB0-PB4 prebuild slices plus P2/P2a completed boundary.
2. `docs/adr/0033-core-schema-book-profile-reader-profile解耦-technical-learning作为当前profile.md` - Core/Profile/Reader boundary rules and 2026-06-26 prebuild execution note.
3. `docs/代码链路.md` - latest touched-symbol ledger including profile prebuild gap documentation.
4. `skills/build/pass1-batch.ts` - current build output writer, currently only writes `base.json` and `source.txt`.
5. `packages/core/src/pass2.ts` - existing `ProfileArtifactHeader`, discourse types, and Pass2 audit sidecar types.

## Decisions made this session
- P2/P2a remain read-time consumption slices; they do not satisfy ADR-0033 prebuild artifact production.
- Added PB0-PB4: profile metadata/header, FormulaSemantics sidecar materialization, TechnicalLearningDiscourseIndex gate/write, Pass2 build/audit sidecar, profile sidecar build smoke.
- ADR-0033 now explicitly records PB0-PB4 as execution slices for already-accepted sidecar rules, not a boundary change.
- Verified documentation with `rg "PB0|PB1|PB2|PB3|PB4|预构建缺口|执行补记" ...`.
